# 💰 Payroll Feature Setup Guide

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Payroll tab not fetching data from database
**Cause**: Query was using incorrect foreign key relationship syntax
**Solution**: Updated to fetch data in separate queries and join manually

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Add Payroll Data to Database

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/add_payroll_data_2025.sql
```

This will:
- Check existing payroll records
- Generate payroll for August, September, October 2025
- Create records for all active employees
- Set realistic salaries based on job titles

### 2. Verify Data Was Added

Run in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payroll;
SELECT month, year, COUNT(*) as records 
FROM payroll 
GROUP BY month, year 
ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC;
```

You should see records for months 8, 9, 10 of 2025.

### 3. Refresh the Payroll Page

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173
2. Login as Admin
3. Click "Payroll" in navigation
4. Select "October 2025"
5. You should now see payroll data!

## 📊 What Was Fixed in Code

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
// This was using a foreign key relationship that doesn't work
const { data: payroll, error } = await supabase
  .from('payroll')
  .select(`
    *,
    employee:profiles!payroll_employee_id_fkey (
      full_name,
      department:departments(name),
      job_title
    )
  `)
```

### After (Working)
```typescript
// Fetch payroll first
const { data: payroll } = await supabase
  .from('payroll')
  .select('*')
  .eq('month', selectedMonth)
  .eq('year', selectedYear);

// Then fetch employee details separately
const { data: employees } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('id, full_name, job_title, department_id')
  .in('id', employeeIds);

// Fetch departments
const { data: departments } = await supabase
  .from('departments')
  .select('id, name')
  .in('id', departmentIds);

// Join data manually using Maps
```

## 💡 Salary Calculation Logic

```
Basic Salary: Based on job title
- Director/CEO: $12,000 - $17,000
- Manager/Head: $8,000 - $12,000
- Senior/Lead: $6,000 - $9,000
- Engineer/Developer: $5,000 - $7,500
- Specialist: $4,000 - $6,000
- Others: $3,500 - $5,000

Allowances (15-25% of basic):
- Housing allowance
- Transport allowance
- Meal allowance

Deductions (5-8% of basic):
- Insurance
- Loans
- Other deductions

Tax (Progressive):
- > $10,000: 25%
- > $7,000: 20%
- > $5,000: 15%
- Others: 10%

Net Salary = Basic + Allowances - Deductions - Tax
```
