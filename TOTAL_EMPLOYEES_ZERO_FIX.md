# üö® URGENT: Total Employees Shows 0

## Problem
- ‚úÖ 3 employees exist in database (Shivika, shal, dkdk)
- ‚úÖ 2 attendance records exist for today
- ‚ùå Total Employees shows **0**
- ‚ùå Employee names show "Unknown"

## Root Cause
**RLS policies on the `profiles` table are blocking recruiters from viewing employee profiles.**

Even though you can see attendance records, the JOIN to get employee names is failing because the recruiter role doesn't have permission to SELECT from the profiles table.

## Immediate Fix

### Step 1: Run This SQL Script
Copy and paste `URGENT_FIX_PROFILES_ACCESS.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

This will:
1. Add a policy allowing recruiters to view all profiles
2. Verify the policy was created
3. Test if you can see employees
4. Show the actual employee list

### Step 2: Check Results
After running the script, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Profiles Policies: Should list multiple policies including "profiles_recruiter_view_all"
‚úÖ Employees Visible: Should show 3
üë• Employee List: Should show Shivika, shal, dkdk with their full details
üßë Your Profile: Should show your profile (Diksha Khandelwal)
```

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Click on Attendance tab
3. Total Employees should now show **3**
4. Employee names should show instead of "Unknown"

## Verification Checklist

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to debug:

### 1. Check if helper function exists:
```sql
SELECT public.get_my_role();
-- Should return: 'recruiter'
```

### 2. Check profiles policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
-- Should include policies for recruiters
```

### 3. Test employee count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'employee';
-- Should return: 3
```

### 4. Test profile join:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.date,
  a.status,
  p.full_name,
  p.email,
  p.role
FROM attendance a
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON a.employee_id = p.id
WHERE a.date = CURRENT_DATE;
-- Should show employee names (not NULL)
```

## If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Run the Full RLS Fix
```sql
-- Run: FIX_ALL_TABLES_RLS.sql
-- This fixes ALL tables at once
```

### Option 2: Check for Errors in Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors like:
   - "policy violation" 
   - "permission denied"
   - "new row violates row-level security"

### Option 3: Verify Policy Structure
The recruiter needs these policies on `profiles`:
- ‚úÖ `profiles_select_own` - View own profile
- ‚úÖ `profiles_recruiter_view_all` - View all profiles (NEW)

## Expected After Fix

### Before:
```
Total Employees: 0
Present Today: 2
Attendance Records (2):
- Unknown (role: ‚Äî) - PRESENT
- Unknown (role: ‚Äî) - PRESENT
```

### After:
```
Total Employees: 3
Present Today: 2
Attendance Records (2):
- Shivika (role: employee) - PRESENT
- shal (role: employee) - PRESENT
```

## Why This Happened

The original `ABSOLUTE_EMERGENCY_FIX.sql` created the `get_my_role()` helper function and basic policies, but it focused on fixing your profile access (which worked - you can log in!).

However, it didn't explicitly add a policy for **recruiters to view OTHER profiles**. The policies created were:
- ‚úÖ Users can view **their own** profile (works)
- ‚úÖ Admins can view **all** profiles (works for admins)
- ‚ùå Recruiters can view **all** profiles (MISSING!)

The `URGENT_FIX_PROFILES_ACCESS.sql` adds that missing policy.

## Next Steps After Fix

Once employee count shows correctly:
1. ‚úÖ Verify attendance records show employee names
2. ‚úÖ Verify "Present Today" count matches attendance records
3. ‚úÖ Test marking attendance as an employee
4. ‚úÖ Verify it appears in recruiter dashboard immediately
