## 📊 Feature Engineering (Auto-computed)

The model automatically calculates:
1. **TenureRatio** - YearsAtCompany / TotalWorkingYears
2. **PromotionFrequency** - 1 / (YearsSincePromotion + 1)
3. **IncomeAgeRatio** - MonthlyIncome / Age
4. **SatisfactionScore** - Average of all satisfaction ratings
5. **IsLowSatisfaction** - Flag if JobSatisfaction ≤ 2
6. **IsLongCommute** - Flag if DistanceFromHome > 15
7. **IsJobHopper** - Flag if NumCompaniesWorked > 3
8. **IsStagnant** - Flag if no promotion for >3 years

## 🤖 AI Explanation Example

**Input**: 64.58% risk, high level
**AI Output**: 
> "This employee is at significant risk of leaving. The combination of low job satisfaction (2/4), poor work-life balance, and 4 years without promotion suggests they may feel undervalued and stagnant. The frequent overtime and long commute (25km) are adding to burnout. Immediate intervention with career development discussion and workload review is critical."

## 🎨 UI Features

1. **Sample Data Button** - One-click test data loading
2. **Real-time Validation** - Form validation on submit
3. **Risk Gauge** - Visual risk score with color coding
4. **Contributing Factors** - Top 5 risk factors listed
