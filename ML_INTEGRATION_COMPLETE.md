# ML Model Integration Complete ✅

## Issue Identified
The original `attrition_predictor.py` was manually creating 11 features, but the trained ML model expected 47 features from the EnhancedPreprocessor.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `attrition_predictor.py`
- **New approach**: Maps HRMS employee data → 47 ML features → Trained model
- **Feature mapping**: Creates DataFrame with all required features (Age, BusinessTravel, DailyRate, Department, etc.)
- **Preprocessing**: Applies same feature engineering as training (TenureRatio, PromotionFrequency, satisfaction flags, etc.)
- **Encoding**: Uses saved label encoders from preprocessor.pkl
- **Scaling**: Uses saved StandardScaler from preprocessor.pkl

### 2. Feature Engineering
The predictor now applies all 16 engineered features:
- TenureRatio, PromotionFrequency, IncomeAgeRatio
- WorkLifeScore, OverallSatisfaction
- IsUnsatisfied, PoorEnvironment, PoorRelationships, PoorWorkLife
- BelowMedianIncome, IsNewHire, IsLongTenure
- StagnantCareer, LongCommute, LowTraining
- AgeGroup, ExperienceLevel

### 3. Intelligent Mapping
Maps HRMS database fields to ML features:
- `salary` → MonthlyIncome, DailyRate, HourlyRate
- `tenure_months` → YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, TotalWorkingYears
- `attendance_rate` → JobSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction (inverse)
- `avg_performance_rating` → PerformanceRating, JobInvolvement
- `overtime_frequency` → OverTime (Yes/No)

### 4. Fallback Mechanism
If ML model fails, falls back to simple rule-based prediction

## Test Results

### High Risk Employee (Poor attendance, high leave, low performance)
```
Risk Score: 37.57% (medium)
Factors:
- Below average attendance (75.0%)
- High leave usage (25 days/year)
- Below average performance (2.5/5)
- Frequent overtime (15 times/3 months)
```

### Low Risk Employee (Good attendance, high performance)
```
Risk Score: 17.92% (low)
Factors:
- Model-based prediction - multiple factors considered
```

## Model Performance
- **Model**: RandomForest (from ensemble training)
- **Accuracy**: 82.99%
- **ROC-AUC**: 79.89%
- **Features**: 47 (11 base + 36 engineered)
- **Top Features**: MonthlyIncome, Age, TotalWorkingYears, DailyRate, OverTime

## How to Use

### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/predict-attrition` - Predict single employee
- `POST /api/predict-performance` - Predict performance
- `POST /api/predict-both` - Both predictions

### Frontend
- Navigate to Recruiter Dashboard
- Click "Predictions" in header
- Select employee
- Click "Predict Attrition Risk"
- View risk score, factors, recommendations

## Integration Flow
```
Frontend (AttritionPredictor.tsx)
  ↓
predictionService.predictBoth()
  ↓
POST /api/predict-both
  ↓
AttritionPerformancePredictor.predict_attrition()
  ↓
map_hrms_to_ml_features() - Create 47 features
  ↓
_engineer_features() - Apply transformations
  ↓
Encode categorical features (label encoders)
  ↓
Scale features (StandardScaler)
  ↓
model.predict_proba() - RandomForest prediction
  ↓
Return: risk_score, risk_level, factors, recommendations
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/ml_models/attrition_predictor.py` - Complete rewrite with ML integration
2. `train_models_enhanced.py` - Added `transform_new_data()` method
3. `backend/ml_models/ml_adapter.py` - Created (alternative adapter, not used)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Backend integration complete
2. ⏳ Restart backend server
3. ⏳ Test end-to-end from UI
4. ⏳ Verify predictions for multiple employees
5. ⏳ Check error handling for edge cases

## Backup
Old predictor saved as: `backend/ml_models/attrition_predictor_old.py`
