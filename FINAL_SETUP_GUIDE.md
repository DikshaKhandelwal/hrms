# 🎯 Complete Setup Summary - Manual Attrition Prediction

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### Issue: Always showing 2.99% low risk
**Root Cause**: Backend endpoint expected old field names (`salary`, `job_title`) but frontend was sending new field names (`monthly_income`, `job_role`)

**Solution**: Created `ManualEmployeeDataRequest` model with correct field names matching the frontend

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
✓ Loaded simple model from ml_models/saved_models\attrition_model_simple.pkl
✓ Loaded preprocessor with 23 features
✓ OpenAI initialized successfully
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access at: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Login (any role works)
2. Click **"Predictions"** button in header
3. Click **"Load Sample Data"** (purple button)
4. Click **"Predict Risk"** (blue button)
5. See results with AI explanation

## 📊 Expected Results

### Sample Data (High Risk)
```
Age: 32
Monthly Income: $4,500
Total Working Years: 10
Years at Company: 3
Job Satisfaction: 2 (Unsatisfied)
Work-Life Balance: 2 (Poor)
Environment Satisfaction: 2 (Unsatisfied)
Job Involvement: 2 (Low)
Performance Rating: 3 (Average)
Overtime: Yes
Distance from Home: 25 km
Previous Companies: 5
Years Since Promotion: 4
Department: Sales
Job Role: Sales Executive
```

**Expected Result:**
- Risk Score: ~97-98% (HIGH RISK)
- Contributing Factors:
  - Low job satisfaction (2/4)
  - Poor work-life balance (2/4)
  - Low environment satisfaction (2/4)
  - Frequent overtime work
  - Long commute distance (25 km)

**AI Explanation (if OpenAI configured):**
> "This employee is at extremely high risk of leaving. The combination of low job satisfaction scores across multiple dimensions (job, work-life balance, environment) along with frequent overtime and a lengthy commute creates a perfect storm for burnout. Immediate intervention is critical - schedule a retention conversation within 24-48 hours to understand concerns and present counter-measures."

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Add to `backend/.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Without OpenAI**: Predictions still work, but AI insights show fallback message

## 🧪 Testing Different Scenarios

### High Risk Employee
- Low satisfaction scores (1-2)
- Overtime = Yes
- Long commute (>20km)
- Many previous companies (>3)
- No promotion for 3+ years

**Expected**: 70-98% risk (HIGH)

### Medium Risk Employee
- Mixed satisfaction scores (2-3)
- Some overtime
- Medium commute (10-20km)
- Few job changes
- Recent promotion

**Expected**: 30-60% risk (MEDIUM)

### Low Risk Employee
- High satisfaction scores (3-4)
- No overtime
- Short commute (<10km)
- Stable employment history
- Recent promotion

**Expected**: 5-25% risk (LOW)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load employee data"
- **Cause**: Old error from database-fetching version
- **Fix**: Already fixed - now uses manual input

### Issue: Always showing 2.99% low risk
- **Cause**: Field name mismatch
- **Fix**: ✅ Fixed - now uses ManualEmployeeDataRequest

### Issue: Backend won't start
- **Check**: Python dependencies installed?
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn xgboost pandas numpy joblib openai python-dotenv
```

### Issue: AI explanation not working
- **Check**: OPENAI_API_KEY in .env?
- **Note**: Predictions work without OpenAI, just no AI insights

### Issue: Frontend not connecting
- **Check**: Backend running on port 8000?
- **Check**: CORS enabled in main.py? (Already configured)

}

result = predictor.predict_attrition(data)
print(f'Risk: {result[\"risk_score\"]}% ({result[\"risk_level\"]})')
print(f'Factors: {len(result[\"contributing_factors\"])}')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Loaded simple model from ml_models/saved_models\attrition_model_simple.pkl
✓ Loaded preprocessor with 23 features
Risk: 97.75% (high)
