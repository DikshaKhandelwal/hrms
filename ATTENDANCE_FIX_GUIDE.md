# 🎯 Attendance Not Visible - Fix Instructions

## Problem
You're logged in as a **recruiter**, but the Attendance tab shows no data even though attendance records exist in the database. This is because:

1. ❌ The RLS (Row Level Security) policies on the `attendance` table don't allow recruiters to view attendance data
2. ❌ The original `AttendancePage` component only shows attendance for the logged-in user (not all employees)

## Solution

### Step 1: Fix RLS Policies ✅ DONE
Created `FIX_ALL_TABLES_RLS.sql` which adds recruiter access to all tables:
- `attendance` - Recruiters can VIEW all records
- `leave_requests` - Recruiters can VIEW all requests  
- `payroll` - Recruiters can VIEW all payroll
- `performance_reviews` - Recruiters can VIEW all reviews

### Step 2: Create Recruiter-Specific Attendance View ✅ DONE
Created `RecruiterAttendanceView.tsx` component that:
- Shows ALL employees' attendance (not just your own)
- Displays attendance stats: Total Employees, Present, On Leave, Absent
- Has a date picker to view historical attendance
- Shows detailed table with employee names, roles, status, check-in/check-out times
- Real-time updates when attendance is marked

### Step 3: Update RecruiterDashboard ✅ DONE
Updated `RecruiterDashboard.tsx` to use the new component for the attendance view.

## How to Apply

### 1. Run the SQL Fix (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of: d:\hrms\supabase\FIX_ALL_TABLES_RLS.sql
-- Into: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run
```

### 2. Verify RLS is Working
```sql
-- Copy and paste: d:\hrms\supabase\TEST_RLS_ACCESS.sql
-- Into: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run
-- Check that all tests return data (not 0)
```

### 3. Restart Your Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test in Browser
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Click on **Attendance** tab in the header
3. You should now see:
   - ✅ Total employee count
   - ✅ Present count for today
   - ✅ Full attendance table with all employees

## What Changed?

### Before:
- 🚫 Recruiters could ONLY see their own attendance (which is none because you're not an employee)
- 🚫 RLS policies blocked access to other employees' data

### After:
- ✅ Recruiters can VIEW all attendance data (for dashboard/reports)
- ✅ Recruiters can VIEW all leave requests
- ✅ Recruiters can VIEW all employee profiles
- ✅ New dedicated attendance view showing all employees
- ✅ Real-time updates when employees mark attendance

## Access Matrix

| Role | Attendance Access |
|------|-------------------|
| **Employee** | View/Create own only |
| **Recruiter** | **View all** ✅ |
| **Senior Manager** | View/Manage department |
| **Admin** | Full access |

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `d:\hrms\supabase\FIX_ALL_TABLES_RLS.sql` - RLS policy fixes
2. ✅ `d:\hrms\src\components\recruiter\RecruiterAttendanceView.tsx` - New component
3. ✅ `d:\hrms\src\components\dashboards\RecruiterDashboard.tsx` - Added routing
4. ✅ `d:\hrms\src\components\shared\Header.tsx` - Already had Attendance button

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing no data?
1. Check console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Run `TEST_RLS_ACCESS.sql` to verify policies are applied
3. Verify you ran `FIX_ALL_TABLES_RLS.sql` completely
4. Check that `public.get_my_role()` function exists and returns 'recruiter'

### Error: "function public.get_my_role() does not exist"?
Run `ABSOLUTE_EMERGENCY_FIX.sql` first - it creates the helper function.

### Still getting 0 attendance records?
Check if attendance data actually exists:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attendance; -- Run as admin/in SQL Editor
```

If it returns 0, no one has marked attendance yet!

## Next Steps

Once attendance is visible:
- ✅ Test marking attendance as an employee
- ✅ Verify it shows up in recruiter dashboard
- ✅ Test leave requests visibility
- ✅ Test payroll visibility (if needed)
